# Welcome to the ESP8266 IoT Workshop

IoT workshop based on ESP8266, a DHT11/22 and NeoPixel RGB LED

# Real World IoT with the ESP8266

## Stream Environmental Conditions to Watson IoT and Analyse IoT Sensor data

Learn how to connect an ESP8266 to Watson IoT over MQTT and stream environmental data from the sensors to the IBM Cloud.Â  Workshop attendees will learn about ESP8266 programming, IoT Security, MQTT, Watson IoT Platform, Node-RED, cloud storage, data analytics and visualisation techniques.

Follow the links to access the different sections of the course:

### [Part 1](/compressed/PART1.md)

Provides an overview to the course, introduces the hardware, and the development tooling. The compressed workshop will not introduce you to ESP8266 device programming.  You have been provided an ESP8266 device that has been pre-configured to connect to the local WiFi network and which sends secure MQTT traffic to the IBM Cloud. You will assemble the LED and Temperature sensor parts and send data to the IBM Cloud.
Part 1 finishes with an overview of the IBM Cloud, the cloud platform used in this workshop and ensures you have a working cloud account with the required resources.

### [Part 2](/compressed/PART2.md)

The second part of the workshop looks at the Internet of Things service on the IBM Cloud and how you connect a device to the IBM Cloud using the MQTT protocol.  This section introduces you to security concepts required to connect the device and the Cloud Platform, using SSL/TLS security and certificates.  You will create a Watson IoT Platform instance and receive your ESP8266 sensor data.

### [Part 3](/compressed/PART3.md)

In this section we look at using a low-code development environment called Node-RED on the IBM Cloud to implement the server side part of the IoT solution.  You will create a dashboard to visualise the IoT data. You will store IoT sensor data in the IBM Cloud.

### [Part 4](/compressed/PART4.md)

The last part of the workshop looks at how useful information can be extracted from the IoT data using analytics.  You will be introduced to the Analytic services available on the IBM Cloud and the tooling the services provide to help you extract useful information from sensor data.

Timing of the day can be found in the [**agenda**](/compressed/AGENDA-SHORT.md)

We've provided all the links used throughout the workshop as well as links to other resources [**here**](/RESOURCES.md) to help you explore a little more about IoT.
