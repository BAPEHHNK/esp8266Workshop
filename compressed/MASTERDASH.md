# View your ESP8266 sensor data in the IBM Cloud

## Lab Objectives

In this Lab you will power up the NeoPixel LED and DHT11 Temperature sensor and send the ESP8266 sensor data to the IBM Cloud.

### Introduction

Make certain you have assembled the NeoPixel LED and DHT-11 temperature sensor correctly. If they get hot or give off a burning electrical smell, unplug the ESP8266 and check the electrical wiring.

### Step 1 - See your ESP8266 data in the IBM Cloud

- Power your ESP8266 with the provided MicroUSB cable by pulling it into your laptop.
